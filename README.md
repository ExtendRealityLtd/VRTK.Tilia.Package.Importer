> ### Utilities -> Tilia Package Importer for the Unity Software
> A helper utility window for the Unity software to allow easy importing of Tilia packages

## Introduction

The Tilia Package Importer allows easy import of the [Tilia] packages into the [Unity] software as the default Unity Package Manager only supports the old `all` route for package listing which is no longer supported on npmjs.
