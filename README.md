> ### Utilities -> Tilia Package Importer for the Unity Software
> A helper utility window for the Unity software to allow easy importing of Tilia packages

## Introduction

The Tilia Package Importer allows easy import of the [Tilia] packages into the [Unity] software as the default Unity Package Manager only supports the old `all` route for package listing which is no longer supported on npmjs.

## Getting Started

Browse to `Main Menu -> Window -> Tilia -> Package Importer` in the Unity software and select the `Package Importer` option.

This will open the `Package Importer` window.

> The package importer will attempt to add the required `Scoped Registry` to your project manifest automatically.

A list of available Tilia packages will then be displayed in the `Package Importer` window and clicking `Add` next to the relevant package will attempt to add that package to your project.
